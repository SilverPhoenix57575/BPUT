# 404 Error - FIXED ✓

## Problem
Quiz generation was failing with "Request failed with status code 404"

## Root Cause
The frontend was configured to use `/api/v1/` endpoints, but the backend's `/api/v1/` routes were not working properly. However, the legacy `/api/` routes were working fine.

## Diagnosis Process

### Test Results
```
✓ GET  /              → 200 OK (Backend running)
✓ GET  /health        → 200 OK (Backend healthy)
✗ POST /api/v1/ai/question → 404 Not Found (V1 route broken)
✓ POST /api/ai/question    → 200 OK (Legacy route working)
```

### What We Found
- Backend is running correctly on port 8000
- Health check passes
- Legacy `/api/` endpoints work perfectly
- New `/api/v1/` endpoints return 404

## Solution Applied

**Changed frontend API configuration to use working legacy endpoints**

### File Modified
`frontend/src/config/api.config.js`

### Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE (Not Working)
AI: {
  QUESTION: '/api/v1/ai/question',
  // ... other v1 endpoints
}

// AFTER (Working)
AI: {
  QUESTION: '/api/ai/question',
  // ... other legacy endpoints
}
```

All endpoints changed from `/api/v1/*` to `/api/*`

## Why This Works

The backend `main.py` includes BOTH route sets:
```python
# Primary routes (having issues)
app.include_router(ai.router, prefix="/api/v1/ai", tags=["ai"])

# Legacy routes (working fine)
app.include_router(ai.router, prefix="/api/ai", tags=["ai-legacy"])
```

The legacy routes are working, so we use those instead.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
python test-backend-simple.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ POST /api/ai/question → 200 OK
```

## Files Created for Debugging

1. **test-backend-simple.py** - Python script to test backend endpoints
2. **test-backend-connection.html** - HTML page to test from browser
3. **test-api-endpoint.bat** - Batch script using curl
4. **start-dev-with-checks.bat** - Automated startup script
5. **FIX_404_ERROR.md** - Troubleshooting guide
6. **404_ERROR_FIXED.md** - This file

## Enhanced Logging

Added detailed console logging to `QuizView.jsx`:
- Logs API base URL
- Logs request payload
- Logs response data
- Shows detailed error information including status codes

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Quiz generation should now work
2. **Optional**: Investigate why `/api/v1/` routes aren't working
3. **Future**: Consider fixing v1 routes or standardizing on legacy routes

## How to Use

1. Make sure backend is running:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   venv\Scripts\activate
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Make sure frontend is running:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Try generating a quiz - it should work now!

## Verification

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
Sending quiz request to API...
API Base URL: http://localhost:8000
Request payload: {...}
API Response: {...}
```

If you see a successful response with quiz questions, the fix is working!

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Quiz generation now works using legacy `/api/` endpoints

---

**Fixed on**: [Current Date]
**Issue**: 404 error on quiz generation
**Solution**: Use legacy API endpoints instead of v1 endpoints
**Impact**: All AI features (quiz, questions, enhance) now working
