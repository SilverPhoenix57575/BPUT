# Quiz Generation - Improved & Fixed âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
Quiz was showing the same questions repeatedly instead of generating new, unique questions from Gemini AI based on difficulty, question count, and question type settings.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Added Randomization Seeds
- Each quiz generation now includes a unique random seed and timestamp
- This ensures Gemini generates DIFFERENT questions each time
- Even for the same topic, you'll get varied questions

#### 2. Enhanced Prompts
- Added "BRAND NEW" and "UNIQUE" instructions to prompts
- Emphasized covering DIVERSE aspects of the topic
- Added creativity instructions to avoid repetitive questions

#### 3. Better Logging
- Added detailed console logging to track quiz generation
- Shows Gemini response content
- Displays parsed questions with their properties
- Helps verify AI is actually being called

## How It Works Now

### Topic-Based Quiz Generation
```
User selects:
- Topic: "Python"
- Difficulty: "Hard"
- Questions: 10
- Type: "Multiple Choice"

â†’ Generates prompt with random seed
â†’ Calls Gemini API via /api/ai/question
â†’ Gemini creates 10 UNIQUE hard MCQ questions about Python
â†’ Questions are parsed and displayed
```

### Content-Based Quiz Generation
```
User pastes content about "Machine Learning"
- Difficulty: "Easy"
- Questions: 5
- Type: "True/False"

â†’ Generates prompt with content + random seed
â†’ Calls Gemini API
â†’ Gemini creates 5 UNIQUE easy T/F questions from content
â†’ Questions are parsed and displayed
```

## Features Confirmed Working

âœ… **Difficulty Levels**
- Easy: Simple, beginner-friendly questions
- Medium: Moderate challenge, concept understanding
- Hard: Complex, deep understanding required
- Adaptive: Mix of all difficulty levels

âœ… **Question Counts**
- 5 questions
- 10 questions
- 20 questions

âœ… **Question Types**
- Multiple Choice (4 options: A, B, C, D)
- True/False (2 options: A) True, B) False)
- All Types (Mix of MCQ and T/F)

âœ… **Any Subject**
- Computer Science topics (Python, Java, Data Structures, etc.)
- Other subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, etc.)
- Custom content from user input

## How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Browser Console (F12)
When you generate a quiz, you should see:
```
Sending quiz request to API...
API Base URL: http://localhost:8000
Request payload: {...}
âœ“ API Response received: {...}
âœ“ Response data: {...}
âœ“ Gemini generated content (first 500 chars): Q: ...
âœ“ Full content length: 2847 characters
âœ“ Successfully parsed 10 questions from Gemini
âœ“ Questions: [{question: "What is...", difficulty: "hard", type: "mcq"}, ...]
```

### 2. Test Different Settings
Try generating multiple quizzes with:
- Same topic, different difficulty â†’ Different questions
- Same topic, different question count â†’ Different questions
- Same topic, different question type â†’ Different format
- Different topics â†’ Completely different questions

### 3. Check Question Quality
- Questions should match the selected difficulty
- Question count should match your selection
- Question format should match your type selection
- Questions should be about the topic you entered

## Example Test Cases

### Test 1: Easy MCQ
```
Topic: Python Basics
Difficulty: Easy
Questions: 5
Type: Multiple Choice

Expected: 5 simple MCQ questions about Python basics
```

### Test 2: Hard True/False
```
Topic: Data Structures
Difficulty: Hard
Questions: 10
Type: True/False

Expected: 10 challenging T/F questions about data structures
```

### Test 3: Mixed Adaptive
```
Topic: Machine Learning
Difficulty: Adaptive
Questions: 20
Type: All Types

Expected: 20 mixed difficulty questions (MCQ + T/F) about ML
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/student/QuizView.jsx`
  - Added random seed generation
  - Enhanced prompt instructions
  - Added detailed console logging
  - Improved error messages

### API Flow
```
Frontend (QuizView.jsx)
  â†“ aiAPI.question(prompt)
Backend (/api/ai/question)
  â†“ answer_question()
AI Service (ai_service.py)
  â†“ Gemini API call
Gemini 2.0 Flash Model
  â†“ Generated quiz content
Backend parses response
  â†“ Returns to frontend
Frontend parses questions
  â†“ Displays quiz
```

### Prompt Structure
```
You are an expert educator creating a UNIQUE quiz about "[TOPIC]" (Session: [RANDOM_SEED]-[TIMESTAMP]).

=== QUIZ REQUIREMENTS ===
Topic: [TOPIC]
Number of Questions: [COUNT]
Difficulty: [LEVEL]
Question Type: [TYPE]

=== DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES ===
[Specific instructions for difficulty level]

=== QUESTION TYPE RULES ===
[Specific instructions for question format]

=== FORMAT EXAMPLES ===
[Example questions in correct format]

=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ===
1. Generate EXACTLY [COUNT] BRAND NEW questions
2. Each question MUST be about "[TOPIC]"
3. Each question MUST test a DIFFERENT concept/subtopic
4. NO duplicate or similar questions to previous quizzes
5. Be CREATIVE and cover DIVERSE aspects of [TOPIC]
...
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see repeated questions:
1. Check browser console for logs
2. Verify Gemini API key is set in `backend/.env`
3. Check backend terminal for errors
4. Try clearing browser cache
5. Try a different topic or settings

### If questions don't match difficulty:
- Check console logs to see actual prompt sent
- Verify difficulty selector is working
- Check Gemini response in console

### If question count is wrong:
- Check console for parsing warnings
- Verify Gemini generated enough questions
- Check for parsing errors in console
