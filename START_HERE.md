## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Dev 1 (Frontend Developer)

1. **Read these files:**
   - `DEV1_FRONTEND_TASKS.md` - Your task list
   - `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Setup guide
   - `API_CONTRACT.md` - API endpoints you'll call

2. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
   cd frontend
   npm install pouchdb zustand axios @tailwindcss/forms lucide-react
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Create branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev1-frontend
   ```

4. **Start building:**
   - Work ONLY in `frontend/` directory
   - Build components from task list
   - Test with mock data first

### For Dev 2 (Backend Developer)

1. **Read these files:**
   - `DEV2_BACKEND_TASKS.md` - Your task list
   - `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Setup guide
   - `API_CONTRACT.md` - API endpoints you'll build

2. **Setup:**
   ```bash
   mkdir backend
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install fastapi uvicorn google-generativeai PyPDF2
   ```

3. **Create branch:**
   ```bash

## 🚫 Merge Conflict Prevention

### Golden Rules:
1. ✅ Dev 1 ONLY touches `frontend/`
2. ✅ Dev 2 ONLY touches `backend/`
3. ✅ Pull before you push
4. ✅ Use separate branches
5. ✅ Communicate before editing shared files

### Your Territories:
```
Dev 1: frontend/**/*
Dev 2: backend/**/*
```

### Shared Files (Coordinate First):
```
README.md
COMPLETE_HACKATHON_ROADMAP.md
.gitignore
```
