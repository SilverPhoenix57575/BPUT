# 📁 Document Storage Implementation

## Current Setup: FastAPI Static Files ✅

### How It Works
1. **Upload**: Files saved to `uploads/` directory
2. **Storage**: Local filesystem storage
3. **Access**: Public URL at `/uploads/{filename}`
4. **Database**: Stores file URL for retrieval

### Example
```python
# Upload returns:
{
  "fileUrl": "/uploads/content_abc123.pdf"
}

# Access at:
http://localhost:8000/uploads/content_abc123.pdf
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Simple and immediate
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Fast access
- ✅ No additional costs

### File Structure
```
backend/
├── uploads/              # Uploaded files stored here
│   ├── content_abc.pdf
│   ├── content_xyz.docx
│   └── content_123.png
└── app.db               # Database with file URLs
```

## Future: Cloud Storage (Optional)

### When to Upgrade
- Need to scale beyond single server
- Want CDN distribution
- Need backup/redundancy
- Multiple server instances

### Options
1. **AWS S3** - Most popular, reliable
2. **Google Cloud Storage** - Good integration
3. **Azure Blob Storage** - Microsoft ecosystem

### Migration Path
1. Keep current implementation
2. Add cloud storage library when needed
3. Update upload endpoint to use cloud
4. Migrate existing files

## Current Implementation Details

### Upload Endpoint
```python
POST /api/content/upload
- Saves file to uploads/
- Extracts text (PDF, DOC, Image)
- Returns public URL
- Stores in database
```

### Access Files
```
GET /uploads/{filename}
- Direct file access
- Served by FastAPI StaticFiles
- No authentication (public)
```

### Database Schema
```python
Content:
  - id: content_abc123
  - filename: document.pdf
  - file_url: /uploads/content_abc123.pdf
  - extracted_text: "..."
```

## No CouchDB/Cloudant Needed

**Why removed:**
- SQLite handles all data storage
- Static files handle document storage
- Simpler architecture
- Easier to deploy
- No external dependencies

**What we use instead:**
- SQLite for structured data
- Local filesystem for files
- FastAPI for serving both

This is production-ready for hackathon and can scale later if needed! 🚀
